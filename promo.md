## Promotion and Description
Attend a Teaching Commons faculty session on AI Feb. 26- Maribel Morales

Faculty are invited to the first Teaching Commons session of the spring semester.

Join us for “Using AI to Build Interactive Classroom Tools (No Coding Required),” led by Professor Mark Mahoney, from 11:40 a.m. to 12:20 p.m. Thursday, Feb. 26, in Lentz Hall 411.

Most conversations about AI in higher education focus on students. This session focuses on how it can help the professors. AI assistants can help faculty create simple interactive tools for the classroom like visualizations, simulations, and step-by-step demonstrations. The surprising part is that faculty don’t need to know how to code.

In this session, Prof. Mahoney will show examples he has built for his own courses and walk through the process of creating one from scratch. We’ll discuss what works, what doesn’t, and what the limitations are. The goal is to give professors a starting point if they want to try this themselves.

This session is for any faculty member curious about practical uses of AI in teaching, regardless of technical background.
